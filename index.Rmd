# Methods

The Poudre River at Lincoln Bridge is:

  - Downstream of only a little bit of urban stormwater

  - Near Odell Brewing CO
  
  - Near an open space area and the Poudre River Trail
  
  - **Downstream of many agricultral diversions**

# Data Acquisition and Plotting tests

## Data Download


```{r downloader}

q <- readNWISdv(siteNumbers = '06752260',
                parameterCd = '00060',
                startDate = '2017-01-01',
                endDate = '2022-01-01') %>%
  rename(q = 'X_00060_00003')


```



## Static Data Plotter


```{r, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5}

ggplot(q, aes(x = Date, y = q)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  ylab('Q (cfs)') + 
  ggtitle('Discharge in the Poudre River, Fort Collins')

```


## Interactive Data Plotter


```{r}
q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)
dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") 
```



# Assignment. 


This assignment will be primarily about demonstrating some expertice in using
RMarkdown, since we will be using Rmds as the primary form of homework and 
assignments. With that in mind, your assignment for this homework is to:


1) Fork the example repository into your personal GitHub
Done

2) Create an RStudio project from your Personal clone of the Repo. 
Done

3) Create a table of contents that is floating, but displays three levels of
headers instead of two (by editing the content at the beginning of the document)
Done

4) Make a version of the `dygraph` with points and lines by using rstudio's
dygraph [guide](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/)
Done

5) Writing a paragraph on the Poudre river with at least three hyperlinks,
**two bolded sections**, and one *italicized phrase*. The content of this paragraph
is not vital, but try to at least make it true and interesting, and, of course,
don't plagiarize. 

6) Knit that document, and then git commit and push to your personal GitHub.
Done

7) Use the GitHub -> Settings -> Pages tab to create a website of your report.

8) Bonus, make the timestamp in the header dynamic. As in it only adds
todays date, not just a static date you enter. 
Done

9) Bonus, create an "index_talk.Rmd" version of your document using the
`revealjs` package. Add link to your original report-style document. 
Done


## DyGraph example. 
```{r}

q_xts <- xts(q$q, order.by = q$Date)


dygraph(q_xts) %>%
  dyAxis("y", label = "Discharge (cfs)") %>%
  dyOptions(drawPoints = TRUE, pointSize = 2.5)
```


## Poudre Paragraph

**The Poudre River**, meaning *Hide the Powder* in French, is the life force of the northern Front Range, supporting a diversity of ecosystems, sustaining local livelihoods, providing cultural value and more (https://poudretrail.org/trail-tour-2/history-of-the-area/). The Poudre River begins in Rocky Mountain National Park and flows throughout the northern Front Range for 125 miles, passing through the plains and Colorado cities, in which it then feeds into the South Platte River. Along this route, the river is fed by rain, snow melt, groundwater, lakes and various other sources within the Cache la Poudre River watershed (https://www.poudrewatershed.org/cache-la-poudre-watershed). 

**Changes** in climatic, anthropogenic and other external variables have influenced the dynamics and characteristics of the Poudre River, resulting in issues such as intense flooding and decreased water quality (https://www.fcgov.com/poudrereportcard/). These issues highlight the need for high quality research and effective management techniques to ensure the contributions and condition of the Poudre River are optimal.
